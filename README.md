# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing — Codveda Internship Level 1

This repository contains my work for the **Codveda Technologies Data Analysis Internship (Level 1)**.  
The project focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing** using **Python** and **pandas**.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this task was to:
1. Load a raw dataset using pandas.
2. Identify and handle missing values.
3. Detect and remove duplicate rows.
4. Standardize inconsistent data formats (categorical values and date formats).
